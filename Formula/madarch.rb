# The Homebrew formula of the madarch release binary (madarch-lfhu).
#
# Install from the maintained tap:
#
#   brew install shady2k/tap/madarch
#
# (or install straight from any tap that carries this file). The formula
# installs the release binary only: no build steps, no dependencies; the
# wiki app rides inside the binary, and every release carries the SHA256
# sums the formula checks.
